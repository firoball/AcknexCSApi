# AcknexCSApi
Implementation of API for Acknex3 Engine in C#

Currently this repo is updated in parallel to the progress of the [WDL2CS](https://github.com/firoball/WDL2CS) transpiler. It can be considered as some sort of empty hull providing interfaces only. Status of today is, there is no actual API functionality implemented yet.
It is used in order to confirm the transpiled code coming from *WDL2CS* is compatible to the Acknex3 API.
A detailed description of this project will follow once things are starting to fill with life.
